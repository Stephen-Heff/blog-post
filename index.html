                The 2022 Fifa World Cup will be taking place in Quatar. This is
                the first time the tournament has been held in the Middle East.
                There will be 32 teams taking part in the tournament to win the
                coveted price, however only one country will prevail.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a Nigieran national, the country I would have picked to win
                the tournament would have been Nigeria, however they failed to
                qualify for this year's World Cup. This would be the 2nd time in
                their history and the first time in my lifetime.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a result of that, there are other team that are very strong
                and have a good chance of winning the tournament. France, the
                defending champions have one of the best teams in the tournament
                and you can never write of the Brazilian sqad, they have won the
                most titles in overall. On the hand, Canada qualified for this
                years tournament and although they do not have the strongest
                team, they may shock the world. And last but not the least, I
                cannot forget Englad. They never quite seem to be able to put it
                all together in this tournament, but on paper they have a decent
                team. Honorable menetions would be Belgium, Spain and Germany.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I had to pick just one team, not based on who has the best
                line up or which team has proven to be dominant, then I would
                pick Argentina. Why? You ask. I would choose Argentina because
                of the one an only Lionel Messi.

                For him to win the world would cement his legacy as one of the
                greatest football players of all time and the greast of his
                generation.
